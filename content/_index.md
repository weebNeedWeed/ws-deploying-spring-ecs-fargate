# Serverless Containers: Deploying Your Application On ECS and Fargate

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Giau Le. Welcome to my workshop on **Amazon Elastic Container Service(Amazon ECS)** and **AWS Fargate**!

In this workshop, we will dive into the core concepts of Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate, exploring what they are and how they work. We will also apply our acquired knowledge by deploying a to-do application called **Momentum** on these services. Then, we will construct a CI/CD pipeline for our application utilizing AWS developer tools, such as **AWS CodePipeline**, **AWS CodeBuild**, and **AWS CodeDeploy**.
